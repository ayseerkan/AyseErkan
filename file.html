				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia pounded targets from practically one end of Ukraine
				to the other Thursday, including Kyiv, bombarding the city while the head of the United Nations was
				visiting in the boldest attack on the capital since Moscow’s forces retreated weeks ago. Nearly a dozen
				people were wounded in the attack on Kyiv, including one who lost a leg and others who were trapped in
				the rubble when two buildings were hit, rescue officials said. The bombardment came barely an hour after
				Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a news conference with U.N. Secretary-General António
				Guterres, who said Ukraine has become “an epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain.” A spokesperson
				said Guterres and his team were safe. Meanwhile, explosions were reported across the country, in Polonne
				in the west, Chernihiv near the border with Belarus, and Fastiv, a large railway hub southwest of the
				capital. The mayor of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, said rockets were intercepted by air defenses.
				Ukrainian authorities also reported intense Russian fire in the Donbas — the eastern industrial
				heartland that the Kremlin says is its main objective — and near Kharkiv, a northeastern city outside
				the Donbas that is seen as key to the offensive. In the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian
				fighters holed up in the steel plant that represents the last pocket of resistance said concentrated
				bombing overnight killed and wounded more people. And authorities warned that a lack of safe drinking
				water inside the city could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and dysentery. In
				Zaporizhzhia, a crucial way station for tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol, an 11-year-old
				boy was among at least three people wounded in a rocket attack that authorities said was the first to
				hit aresidential area in the southern city since the war began. Shards of glass cut the boy’s leg to the
				bone. Vadym Vodostoyev, the boy’s father, said: “It just takes one second and you’re left with nothing.”
